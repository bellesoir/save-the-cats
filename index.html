                <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
                <p>A single pair of cats and their kittens can produce as many as 420,000 kittens in just 7 years!</p>

                <h2>Up A Tree</h2>
                <p> Squirrels have a joint in their hind feet that allows them to rotate their feet backwards so that they can hang onto a tree regardless of the orientation of their body. Cats can't do that. If they haven't learned to climb down backwards, they're stuck waiting for rescue.</p>

                <h2>Whisker Check</h2>
                <p>A cat's whiskers are approximately equal to its body width, and help to determine how wide an opening is. If the whiskers brush the sides of the hole, the cat knows her body wonâ€™t fit.</p>
